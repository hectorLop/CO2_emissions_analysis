## Project Description
The objective of this project is to generate forecast for the CO2 emissions related to electricity generation in Spain. The data comes from the Spanish Electrical Network (https://www.ree.es/), from
that a time series problem arises. Different techniques have been used to analyze the data, such as the STL decomposition, the KPSS test, ... in addition to various models such as SARIMA (Seasonal Arima)
and FBProphet so far. In the future I will study how to apply other types of modeling techniques, such as neural networks and other classification algorithms, to check which one produces the best results.
